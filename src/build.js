// Music Atlas is served as one self-contained page, but it is not written as one.
// This joins the three sources into that page:
//
//   head.html   CSS and markup
//   data.js     FAMS, DATA, ART, PLAY, SPLAY, DESC, COVER, PTITLE, FAMSKIN, FAMMAP, MODES, ...
//   app.js      layout, rendering, interaction
//
//   node src/build.js      ->  writes index.html at the repo root
//
// data.js ends with a module.exports tail so it can be required by scripts and tests;
// that tail is stripped on the way in, since the page has no module system. The cut is
// at an explicit sentinel line, and the build refuses to run without exactly one: an
// earlier version cut at the first "if (typeof module", so any table that happened to
// contain that text would have silently truncated the page.
//
// The six artist-keyed tables (ROSTER, SONGS, ACTIVE, ROLE, COVERART, PHOTO) are most of
// data.js by bytes and nothing reads them until a search or a panel opens. They go into
// the page as inert <script type="application/json"> blocks, which the HTML parser skips
// over, and a getter on globalThis parses each one the first time its name is read. The
// page is still one file; the engine just stops paying to compile 470 KB of names
// before it can draw the map. They are still ordinary consts in data.js.
