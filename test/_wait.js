// 700ms is enough". That is wrong in both directions at once. On an idle machine almost
// every one of them is far longer than the thing it waits for, which is why a full run took
// two and a half minutes of which eighteen seconds was CPU. Under load some of them are too
// short, which is where the suite's flakiness came from: a check that fails one run in five
// is not finding a bug, it is reporting that the stopwatch lost a race.
//
// So: say what you are waiting for.

//                          for "wait for the sheet to finish opening", and the one to reach
