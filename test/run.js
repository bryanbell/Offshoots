// Runs every *.test.js against the built index.html and exits non-zero if any check fails.
//
//   node src/build.js && node test/run.js            all suites, four at a time
//   node test/run.js root sheet                      just those
//   node test/run.js -1                              one at a time, output in order
//
// Each suite drives a real Chromium through Playwright and prints one line per check,
// prefixed PASS or FAIL. They load index.html over file://, so assets/style-cover-art/ resolves from the
// repo's own folder and covers render exactly as they do when served.
//
// Why it runs them in parallel: most of a suite's time is a page loading or a wait for
// the page to settle, not CPU, so four at a time on two cores cuts the wall clock to
// roughly the longest suite plus sheet.test.js. A full run is about five minutes. Output
// is captured per suite and printed whole, so interleaving never garbles a line.
//
// The summary's "N dead waits" column counts waits that ran to their cap (see _wait.js).
// Each one is ten seconds of nothing, and two suites were once nearly all of that: xplay
// and contrast spent 363s and 495s waiting for a sheet to open on pages that open with
// it shut by design, and passed. Run the suite alone to see which lines.
//
// One trap worth knowing: changing location.hash on a page that is already loaded is a
// same-document navigation, so the app does not re-select. Every suite opens a style on
// a fresh page instead. Several false failures in this project came from reusing one.

// sheet.test.js runs on its own. Its frame-counting is gone, but it still proves the drag

// how far the pointer went in how long, so the gesture cannot be seeked or faked without
// testing something other than the thing. Four Chromiums on two cores stretch those steps,
// a slow drag arrives as a flick and a flick as a drag, and the suite reports the machine.

// of how long they took last time, which is the classic way to pack a queue onto a fixed
