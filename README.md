# Offshoots

Interactive map of popular music styles: trace what any style grew out of
and what grew out of it. The spine is American, but the lines cross oceans —
Jamaica, the UK, Brazil, West Africa, Cuba and more are all in here, because
the music does not stay put. Built for the School of Listening class.

Live: https://offshoots.netlify.app/

460 styles across 16 families, 1,130 parent-to-child connections, 277 written
descriptions, and 270 styles with a playlist on Apple Music and Spotify.

## What's in here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The whole app, built and ready to serve. Generated: edit `src/`, not this |
| `src/` | The files it is built from |
| `test/` | Browser checks that drive the built page |
| `art/` | Playlist cover art, one square JPEG per style |

Netlify serves this directory as-is. No build command, no publish subdirectory:
`index.html` is committed already built.

## How the connections work

Each style stores only its parents, as a space-separated list of style ids:

```
["rocknroll","Rock and Roll",1954,"rock","rnb jump boogie nola_rnb honkytonk gospel", ...]
                                       |- parents: 6 ids
```

Children are derived at load time by inverting that list, so every edge is written
once, in one direction. A style with no parents is a root; roots are drawn with a
ring instead of a filled dot.

The map draws two generations in each direction from the selected style, not the
whole ancestry. The ancestor and descendant counts in the panel come from a full
breadth-first walk, so they run deeper than the lines you see.

Ids are lowercase, stable and arbitrary (`nola_rnb`, `twotone`, `scrap`). Renaming a
style is safe. Changing an id means updating every parent list that references it.

## Color

Families take their color from the School of Listening cover palette. Each shelf's
cover field supplies the hue, lifted to a lightness that reads on the dark map; for
the shelves whose covers are near-black, the cover accent supplies it instead. The
same palette tints the detail panel, so a style's panel, its lane, its dot and its
lines are all the same family color.

## Building

`index.html` is generated. Edit the files in `src/` and rebuild:

```
node src/build.js      # writes index.html at the repo root
```

```
src/head.html   CSS and markup
src/data.js     families, styles, parents, artists, playlists, descriptions, covers, modes
src/app.js      layout, rendering, interaction
src/build.js    joins the three into index.html
```

`data.js` ends with a `module.exports` tail so scripts and tests can `require()` it;
the build strips that tail, since the page has no module system. That makes checks
like this possible without a browser:

```
node -e 'const {DATA,COVER}=require("./src/data.js"); /* ... */'
```

Commit `index.html` along with the source change. Netlify serves the committed file,
so a source edit that is not rebuilt will not reach the site.

### Why it is still one file

Splitting the served page into separate js and css would buy better caching on a
repeat visit and not much else. Against that, a self-contained page can be mailed,
opened from a disk or dropped into any host, and every extra fetched file is another
relative URL that can resolve wrong where the page is served from a path with no
trailing slash. That has already bitten once: see `artBase()` in `app.js`, which
exists because `art/x.jpg` resolved against the parent directory and every cover
404'd. The maintenance argument for splitting is already answered by `src/`.

## Tests

```
npm install            # playwright, once
npm test               # rebuilds, then runs every test/*.test.js
```

92 checks across five suites, driving a real Chromium against the built page at
mobile and desktop widths: the back trail, the listening modes, the browse menus,
sharing from the title, and the root panel. Each prints one line per check and the
runner exits non-zero if any fails.

They load `index.html` over `file://`, so `art/` resolves from this folder and covers
render exactly as they do when served.

One trap worth knowing before adding a test: setting `location.hash` on a page that
is already loaded is a same-document navigation, so the app does not re-select and
the panel keeps showing the previous style. Open each style on a fresh page. Several
false failures in this project came from reusing one.
