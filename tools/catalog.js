// Music Atlas as data, for a reader that is not a person.
//
// The map is a picture, and a picture is the one thing a language model cannot read. This
// writes the same contents as one JSON file someone can point a model at and ask for
// somewhere to go next: every style with its year, family, lineage, description, artists,
// songs and playlists, plus the playlists that cross between styles.
//
// It is generated from src/data.js, so it cannot drift from what the app shows, and it is
// written at build time rather than fetched at runtime: the page stays one file that
// works with no connection, and this sits beside it like the art folders do.
//
//   node tools/catalog.js      ->  writes musicatlas.json at the repo root
