Fetch artist photos from Wikimedia Commons, via Wikidata, for Offshoots' key artists.

Why Commons and not Spotify or Apple: Offshoots is one file plus a folder you drag to
Netlify, and it works offline. Spotify's and Apple's images may be displayed from their
servers but not downloaded and redistributed, so using them would mean hotlinking, which
breaks the installed copy and tells every one of those services who is reading. Commons
images are freely licensed, so they can be resized, shipped and cached. They need a
credit line, which is what credits.json is for.

Accuracy over coverage. Searching Wikidata by name alone finds the wrong Odetta sooner
or later, and a wrong face is worse than no face, because the glyph fallback already
looks deliberate. So a candidate is only accepted if Wikidata says it is a music act, by
carrying a MusicBrainz or Spotify artist ID. Anything else is recorded as a miss and
keeps its glyph.

Run it on your own machine, not in a Claude session: both sandboxes sit behind a network
allowlist that blocks Wikidata and Commons.

    pip3 install pillow
    python3 artist-photos.py keyartists.json ./artists

Resumable: a name whose file is already there is skipped, so you can stop it and run it
again. Writes artists/credits.json and artists/report.txt when it finishes.
